Project: STM32F103C8T6 HAL project generated by STM32CubeMX, compiled and flashed via Keil5. Code authored in Cursor.

Rules:
- Only modify code inside USER CODE BEGIN / END blocks.
- Use HAL APIs only; avoid direct register access unless necessary.
- New modules go under Core/Src and Core/Inc as <module>.c/.h.
- Function names use snake_case; types use UpperCamelCase; macros use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- All functions must have brief comments; public APIs must have doxygen-style headers.
- For peripherals (UART, SPI, ADC, etc.), expose init(), deinit(), and non-blocking APIs.
- If FreeRTOS is enabled, integrate drivers with tasks and queues.
- Avoid blocking delays; use timers or RTOS mechanisms.
- Provide minimal working examples in main.c USER CODE blocks.
- Never modify CubeMX-generated startup or system files.

Style:
- Indent with 4 spaces.
- Use static for file-scope functions.
- Prefer const correctness and explicit types.

Testing:
- Add simple self-tests or debug logs via UART.
- Use Error_Handler() for fault isolation.
